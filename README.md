ReVewEvaluation
==============

This package contains three sets of MViewADL artifacts that are part of the evaluation of my [PhD](https://lirias.kuleuven.be/handle/123456789/428038). Each set fully describes the eMedia case study using a particular technique for description reuse (ReVew, Import and Flatten).

## structure

- `ePub-flat` --- artifacts using the flatten technique (essentially manual copy and change)
- `ePub-import` --- artifacts using the import technique (reuse of unchanged parts of the description)
- `ePub-revew` --- artifacts using the ReVew technique (multi-view refinement of architecture descriptions) that is developed as part of the PhD.
